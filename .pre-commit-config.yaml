  # Note: Type checking (mypy) and Django migrations check are not included in pre-commit
  # because they require a full Django environment setup with database and storage configuration.
  # Run these checks via tox instead:
  #   - Type checking: uv run tox -e type
  #   - Migrations: uv run tox -e check-migrations
  #   - All checks: uv run tox
