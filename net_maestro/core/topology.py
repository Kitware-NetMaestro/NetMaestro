"""Access to the fluid-flow WAN topology YAML files.

Topologies are FFW topology YAML files, the same format the model reads via its
`topology_yaml_file` setting, and they live in `settings.TOPOLOGY_DIR`, by default
the repo's `data/topologies`, which holds the checked-in presets. This module
turns those files into the flat switch/link shape the topology page renders, and
writes new ones back out in that format. The model resolves that setting relative
to the traffic config naming it, so a run needs the file copied beside its config.

TODO: Remove this module once Topology/TopologyNode/TopologyLink models exist
and topologies are database-backed rather than files.
